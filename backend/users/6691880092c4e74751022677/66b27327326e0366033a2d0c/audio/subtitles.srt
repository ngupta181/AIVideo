South Africa, Musk had a keen interest in computers and

4
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:15,825
technology from a young age. At just 12, he created

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:19,781
and sold his first video game. In 1995, he left

00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:23,737
Stanford after only two days to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams,

7
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:27,694
starting Zip2, an online city guide, which he later sold

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,650
for nearly $300 million. Then came X.com, which would eventually
