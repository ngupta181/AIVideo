whirlwind history of

7
00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:08,349
the United States!

8
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:09,542
July 4, 1776:

9
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,735
The Declaration of

10
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:11,927
Independence is signed,

11
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:13,120
paving the way

12
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,313
for the formation

13
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:15,506
of the United

14
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:16,699
States! The Revolutionary

15
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:17,892
War erupts, and

16
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,084
against all odds,

17
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:20,277
the thirteen colonies

18
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:21,470
defeat the mighty

19
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,663
British Empire to

20
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:23,855
secure their freedom!

21
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:25,048
Fast forward to

22
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:26,241
1861, the Civil

23
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:27,434
War breaks out,

24
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:28,627
tearing the nation

25
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:29,819
apart. The Union

26
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,012
and the Confederacy

27
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:32,205
clash, leading to

28
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:33,398
one of the

29
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,591
bloodiest periods in

30
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,784
American history. Abraham

31
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:36,976
Lincoln delivers the

32
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:38,169
Emancipation Proclamation, a

33
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,362
significant step toward

34
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:40,555
abolishing slavery and

35
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:41,748
uniting the country.

36
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:42,940
The 20th century

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,133
ushers in immense

38
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,326
change—World War I,

39
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:46,519
the Great Depression,

40
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:47,711
and World War

41
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:48,904
II, shaping America

42
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:50,097
into a global

43
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,290
leader. The Civil

44
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,483
Rights Movement of

45
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:53,675
the 1960s brings

46
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:54,868
monumental changes—Martin Luther

47
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:56,061
King Jr. becomes

48
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:57,254
a symbol of

49
00:00:57,254 --> 00:00:58,447
hope and equality.

50
00:00:58,447 --> 00:00:59,639
In the final

51
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:00,832
stretch, the turn

52
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:02,025
of the century

53
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:03,218
brings technological advancements,

54
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:04,411
marking the rise

55
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,604
of the digital

56
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:06,796
era and changing

57
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:07,989
the way we

58
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:09,182
live forever. And

59
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:10,375
we're out of

60
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,568
time! That was

61
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:12,760
a super-fast ride

62
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,953
